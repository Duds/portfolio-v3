## The Service Design Challenge

### Context: Multi-Site Mining Operations

Rio Tinto Aluminium faced complex challenges coordinating programs across multiple mining sites:

**Distributed Operations:**
- Projects spanning multiple mine sites
- Remote locations with varying connectivity
- Distributed project teams
- Mix of internal staff and contractors
- Varying project maturity and complexity

**Governance Challenges:**
- Inconsistent project delivery approaches across sites
- Limited visibility of program portfolio
- Difficulty coordinating resources across locations
- Inconsistent reporting and communication
- Challenges tracking dependencies between projects

**Service Need:**
How do you design a program governance service that:
- Coordinates projects across multiple remote mine sites
- Provides consistent project delivery standards
- Enables resource coordination across locations
- Gives portfolio-level visibility to leadership
- Works with mining industry realities (remote, harsh conditions, rotating workforces)
