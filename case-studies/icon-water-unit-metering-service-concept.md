## Challenge

Icon Water needed to implement significant changes to unit (apartment) water metering in the ACT, affecting thousands of multi-unit residential properties. The changes would impact:

- **Property Owners:** New compliance requirements for meter installation and maintenance
- **Body Corporates:** New responsibilities for meter management
- **Tenants:** Changes to billing arrangements and water usage visibility
- **Plumbers & Contractors:** New technical standards and certification requirements
- **Icon Water Staff:** New processes for meter reading, billing, and customer support

The regulatory changes were mandatory, but Icon Water needed a service delivery approach that would:
- Minimize disruption to customers
- Ensure smooth transition to new metering arrangements
- Provide clear guidance through complex regulatory requirements
- Build capability across multiple stakeholder groups
- Maintain customer satisfaction during significant change
