## The Service Design Challenge

### Context: Border Control Field Inspections

A government agency responsible for border control needed to modernise how field inspectors verified compliance with regulatory requirements:

**Field Inspection Reality:**
- Inspectors working across multiple locations (airports, ports, remote sites)
- Varying levels of inspection consistency
- Manual, paper-based processes
- Limited real-time support or guidance
- Difficulty tracking quality outcomes
- No systematic approach to capturing field intelligence

**Service Challenge:**
How do you ensure consistent, high-quality field inspections when:
- Inspectors work independently in distributed locations
- Procedures and policies must be applied consistently
- Incidents must be managed effectively in real-time
- Quality outcomes need to be tracked and improved
- Field intelligence needs to be captured systematically
- Sovereign security risks must be managed

- Step-by-step guidance for complex inspections
- Decision support for edge cases
- Quality checks built into process
- Consistent application of policy and regulation

**2. Field Inspector Support:**
- Mobile-first service delivery
- Works in varying connectivity conditions (airports have wifi, remote sites may not)
- Intuitive interfaces designed for field use
- Real-time access to guidance and support
- Efficient capture of inspection results

**3. Incident Management:**
- Structured approach to handling violations or issues
- Real-time escalation when needed
- Evidence capture and documentation
- Follow-up workflow management
- Audit trail for compliance

**4. Quality & Intelligence:**
- Systematic capture of field intelligence

- Continuous improvement feedback loops
- Performance visibility for management

### Service Blueprinting

**Frontstage (Field Inspector Experience):**
- Receive inspection assignment
- Access relevant procedures and guidance
- Conduct verification following standardised workflow
- Capture results and evidence
- Escalate issues if needed
- Complete inspection and move to next

**Backstage (Supporting Systems):**
- Case management and workflow orchestration
- Procedure and policy library (version controlled)
- Intelligence and risk databases
- Quality assurance processes
- Reporting and analytics
- Integration with border systems

**Service Touchpoints:**
- Pre-inspection briefing
- Field inspection conduct
- Real-time support access
- Result capture and submission
- Post-inspection follow-up
- Quality review and feedback

---

## Implementation Approach

### Co-Design with Field Inspectors

**Prototyping Process:**
- Created low-fidelity prototypes tested with inspectors
- Refined based on field testing feedback
- Validated service model through pilot implementations
- Iteratively improved based on actual use

**Critical Design Decisions:**

**Mobile-First but Connectivity-Aware:**
- Service works online or offline as needed
- Automatic synchronisation when connectivity available
- Field inspectors don't need to think about connection status
- System handles sync transparently

**Workflow-Driven, Not Form-Driven:**
- Interface guides through inspection process
- Context-sensitive help and guidance
- Intelligent defaults reduce data entry
- Quality checks embedded in workflow

**Evidence Capture:**
- Photo and document capture in field
- Linked directly to inspection cases
- Audit trail automatically maintained
- Secure handling of sensitive information

### Service Implementation

The service was implemented using:
- **Dynamics 365** for case management and workflow
- **PowerApps** for field inspector mobile interface
- **Azure Cognitive Services** for enhanced verification accuracy
- **Integration** with existing border control systems

**Technology Role:** Enables the designed service—service design drove technology selection and configuration.

## Key Service Design Learnings

### 1. Design with Field Reality, Not Desk Assumptions

**Approach:** Shadowed actual field inspectors
- Observed real-world constraints (time pressure, conditions, interruptions)
- Understood how decisions are actually made in field
- Identified workarounds and pain points
- Co-designed solutions with end users

**Learning:** Field service design requires understanding field reality—desk research and assumptions aren't enough.

### 2. Mobile-First Doesn't Mean Mobile-Only

**Service Need:** Work in varying connectivity conditions
- Airports have reliable wifi
- Remote sites may have limited or no connectivity
- Inspectors move between connected and disconnected environments

**Service Design:** Connectivity-aware but transparent
- Works offline or online seamlessly
- Automatic sync when possible
- Inspector doesn't manage connection status
- System handles complexity in background

**Impact:** Service works in all field conditions without requiring inspector attention to technical details.

### 3. Quality Built Into Workflow, Not Checked After

**Old Approach:** Inspect, then quality review later
**New Approach:** Quality checks embedded in inspection workflow

**Service Design:**
- Mandatory fields prevent incomplete inspections
- Real-time validation catches errors immediately
- Guidance prevents common mistakes
- Quality feedback loop from management to inspector

**Result:** Improved quality at source, reduced rework, faster processing.

### 4. Service Design for Multiple Stakeholder Types

**Challenge:** Service supports different user types
- Field inspectors (primary)
- Quarantine agents (external)
- Service providers (third-party)
- Security inspectors (specialist)

**Service Solution:** Common service framework with role-specific workflows
- Core verification service model applicable to all
- Customised interfaces and workflows per role
- Shared case management and intelligence
- Consistent quality across stakeholder types

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how service design can transform field operations by focusing on user needs in context, designing for real-world conditions, and building quality into workflows rather than checking it after.

**Key Service Design Achievements:**
- Translated field inspection needs into systematic service model
- Achieved 60% reduction in processing time while improving quality to 99.9%
- Designed for field reality (connectivity, time pressure, varying conditions)
- Improved experience for both inspectors (better tools) and travellers (faster, consistent service)
- Created scalable service framework supporting multiple stakeholder types

**The service design approach—not just technology—enabled this success.** By understanding how inspectors actually work in field conditions, co-designing solutions with end users, and building quality into workflows, we created a service that improved both efficiency and effectiveness.

The verification service model is now deployed across border control operations and provides a replicable framework for other field inspection services.
