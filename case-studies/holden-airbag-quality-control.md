## The Safety System Design Challenge

### Context: Critical Control in Automotive Safety

**The Problem:**
Airbag computers must be installed with precise torque to ensure correct operation during a collision. Too loose and the airbag may not deploy; over-torqued and it might deploy during normal driving. This is a **critical control**—failure is not acceptable.

**Installation Challenge:**
- Airbag computers screwed to vehicle firewall (pressed steel)
- Screw holes sometimes ill-formed during part manufacture
- Self-tapping screws normally fine, but airbag requires precise torque
- Torque drivers sometimes "torque-out" before screw fully installed
- Operators working upside-down on their back in awkward positions
- Both hands required (holding part, driver, and screws)
- Time pressure on production line

**Service Design Challenge:**
How do you design a system that makes it impossible to install an airbag incorrectly—even when:
- Parts are imperfect (ill-formed screw holes)
- Conditions are difficult (awkward position, time pressure)
- Human error is possible (fatigue, distraction, technique variation)
- Safety is absolutely critical (lives depend on correct installation)

<span class="section-label">The Approach</span>

## Service Design Approach: Poka-Yoke

**Poka-yoke** (Japanese: *poka* = mistakes; *yoke*ru = avoid) means to mistake-proof a process. The goal: **make errors impossible, not just detectable**.

### Discovery Phase: Understanding the Operators

**Kaizen Team Assembly:**
- Formed cross-functional team including assembly operators
- Conducted contextual inquiry with operators performing task
- Observed installation process in real production conditions
- Documented challenges and failure modes

**Operator Context Understood:**
- Working upside-down on their back to reach firewall
- Torque driver held at slight angle to avoid other parts
- Both hands required (cannot easily check installation)
- "Double-tap" technique used by experienced operators (not ideal ergonomically)
- Uncertainty when torque-out occurs—is it installed correctly?

**Failure Mode Analysis:**
- Ill-formed screw holes (manufacturing variation)
- Paint runs in screw holes
- Swarf or loose material in holes
- Screws not driven perpendicular to surface
- Torque-out indicates problem—but which problem?

### Problem Definition with Operators

Working with assembly workers, we defined the service need:

> "As an assembly operator, I need to **know with certainty** that the airbag is installed correctly at the correct torque in a short time, so that I can move to the next task **without uncertainty or worry** about safety."

**Key Insight:** The problem isn't just quality—it's **operator confidence and certainty**. Uncertainty creates stress and slows down production.

## Co-Design & Ideation

### User Needs Identified

Through workshops with assembly operators:

**Verification Needs:**
- Confirmation of precise torque achieved
- Verification of specific number of screw turns (indicates full threading)
- Clear indication of successful installation
- Must work in difficult working position

**Interface Preferences:**
- **Audible and tactile feedback preferred over visual**
  - Can't easily see when working upside-down
  - Eyes focused on installation point
  - Hands-free confirmation
- Simple, unambiguous signals (success/failure)
- No additional steps or complexity in workflow

**Error-Proofing Requirements:**
- Impossible to proceed without correct installation
- Clear feedback when problem occurs
- System verifies installation, not operator
- Traceability for quality audits

### Service Design Solution: Smart Verification System

**Design Principle:** Build verification into the tool itself—make the tool unable to complete without correct installation.

**Service Model:**
1. Tool detects when vehicle arrives at station
2. Monitors each screw installation in real-time
3. Counts revolutions (verifies full threading)
4. Confirms torque clutch activation (verifies precise torque)
5. Requires six successful installations before moving on
6. Provides immediate audible/tactile feedback
7. Generates digital certificate of installation

## Prototyping Journey

### Iterative Development with Operators

**Prototype 1: Basic Validation:**
- Disassembled torque driver
- Added rotation sensor in clutch mechanism
- Installed counting circuit
- LED indicator for completion
- **Operator Feedback:** Can't see LED when working upside-down

**Prototype 2: Better Feedback:**
- Replaced LED with piezo buzzer (audible feedback)
- **Operator Feedback:** Much better—can hear confirmation

**Prototype 3: Enhanced Feedback:**
- Added haptic feedback through vibration motor
- Combined audible beep + vibration = clear confirmation
- **Operator Feedback:** Perfect—clear signal without looking

**Prototype 4: Integration:**

- Real-time tracking of installation status
- **Operator Feedback:** Seamless integration with workflow

**Final Prototype:**
- Miniaturised circuit board fitted inside torque driver handle
- All feedback mechanisms integrated
- Digital certification system
- Production-ready design

## Error-Proof System Design

### How the Service Works

**1. Context Awareness:**
- System knows which vehicle is at station
- Knows which airbag computer model required
- Knows expected screw count and torque specification

**2. Real-Time Verification:**
- Counts each screw revolution
- Monitors torque clutch activation
- Verifies all six screws installed correctly
- Detects anomalies (insufficient turns, incorrect torque)

**3. Immediate Feedback:**
- Audible beep on successful installation
- Haptic vibration confirms each screw
- Different signal pattern if problem detected
- Operator knows immediately—no uncertainty

**4. Error Prevention:**
- System won't allow vehicle to proceed without six successful installations
- Flags issues immediately for correction
- Creates digital installation certificate
- Traceable audit trail for quality assurance

### Technology as Service Enabler

The error-proof service was enabled using:
- Custom circuit board (rotation sensor, counting logic, feedback mechanisms)
- Industrial ethernet radio (PLC integration)
- Assembly line system integration
- Digital certification database

**Technology Role:** Enables the designed error-proof service—but the service design (how verification works, feedback mechanisms, integration with workflow) drove the technical solution.

## Key Service Design Learnings

### 1. Co-Design with End Users in Context

**Approach:** Designed with assembly operators, not for them
- Kaizen team included actual operators
- Observed real working conditions (upside-down, awkward positions)
- Tested prototypes in production context
- Iterated based on operator feedback

**Learning:** Operators knew immediately that LED wouldn't work—they couldn't see it. Co-design prevented wasted development on wrong solution.

### 2. Critical Control Thinking from Mining

**Application:** Mining industry principle applied to automotive safety
- Identify critical controls where failure is unacceptable
- Design for error-proofing, not just detection
- Make errors impossible, not just visible
- Verify at point of occurrence, not later

**Impact:** This mindset—from mining operations background—directly informed the error-proof design approach.

### 3. Human Factors in Error-Proofing

**Understanding:** Errors happen despite best intentions
- Fatigue, distraction, time pressure are real
- Awkward positions increase error likelihood
- Uncertainty creates stress and slows production
- Good operators still make occasional mistakes

**Design Response:** Make errors impossible through system design
- Technology verifies what humans cannot easily verify
- Immediate feedback reduces uncertainty
- Error-proofing supports operators, doesn't blame them

### 4. Feedback Mechanisms Matter

**Discovery:** Feedback method critical for working conditions
- Visual feedback doesn't work when operator can't see
- Audible feedback works hands-free
- Haptic feedback works in noisy environments
- Combined modalities provide redundancy

**Service Design:** Match feedback to user context, not technical convenience.

## Poka-Yoke Principles Applied

**1. Prevention Over Detection:**
- Make incorrect installation impossible, don't just detect it later

**2. Immediate Feedback:**
- Operator knows installation status instantly, not after quality check

**3. Simple and Unambiguous:**
- Clear success/failure signals, no interpretation required

**4. Integrated into Workflow:**
- No additional steps for operator, verification is automatic

**5. Error-Proof, Not Error-Prone:**
- System handles complexity, operator gets simple confirmation
