<span class="section-label">The Challenge</span>

## Challenge

In an increasingly competitive higher education environment, digital agility became crucial for supporting organisational collaboration and cross-disciplinary networks. The university faced several challenges:

- Wide diversity of digital collaboration tools
- Varying levels of digital records capability
- Inconsistent use of platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint)
- Multiple collaboration tools (Trello, Slack, Monday, Asana, Jira)
- Confusion around Microsoft tools usage

These challenges created:

- Difficulties in standardising collaboration
- Challenges in supporting users
- Risks to intellectual property
- Legal and privacy concerns
