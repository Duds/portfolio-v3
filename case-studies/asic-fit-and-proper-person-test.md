## The Regulatory Service Design Challenge

### Context: Fit and Proper Person Assessment

Regulatory agencies face complex challenges in determining whether individuals and entities meet "fit and proper person" (FPP) standards:

**Assessment Complexity:**
- No definitive standard—criteria varies across legislation
- Requires investigation of character, relationships, and history
- Involves open-source intelligence gathering (OSINT)
- Relies heavily on individual investigator judgement
- Risk of missing critical relationship changes
- Time-consuming manual research processes

**Service Challenge:**
For a government agency responsible for financial services regulation, the FPP assessment process was:
- Heavily dependent on individual investigative experience
- Inconsistent across different assessors
- Slow due to waiting for information
- At risk of missing entity relationship changes
- Lacking in systematic approach to decision-making

### Service Need

How do you design a regulatory assessment service that:
- Reduces reliance on individual judgement and experience
- Enables collaborative team-based assessment
- Proactively identifies changes in entity relationships
- Systematises the assessment process
- Maintains rigorous regulatory standards
- Improves processing time without compromising quality

<span class="section-label">The Approach</span>

## Service Design Approach

### Discovery Phase: Understanding the Service

**Process Mapping:**
- Mapped existing FPP assessment workflows from application to decision
- Identified bottlenecks: information gathering, OSINT research, waiting periods
- Documented decision points requiring investigative judgement
- Analysed sources of inconsistency across assessors

**User Research:**
- Interviewed regulatory staff conducting FPP assessments
- Observed assessment workflows and decision-making processes
- Identified pain points: repetitive research, manual tracking, relationship complexity
- Understood what information drives assessment decisions

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Regulatory assessors and investigators
- Applicants (individuals and entities seeking authorisation)
- Internal review teams
- External data sources and intelligence providers

### Define Phase: Service Requirements

**Service Blueprint Requirements:**

**Frontstage (Applicant-Facing):**
- Clear application process
- Transparent assessment criteria
- Status visibility and updates
- Support for enquiries

**Backstage (Regulatory Assessment):**
- Systematic approach to entity assessment
- Collaborative team-based reviews
- Real-time monitoring of entity relationships
- Proactive identification of changes
- Decision support tools
- Audit trail and evidence management

**Support Services:**
- Automated information gathering from multiple sources
- Financial, governance, and media monitoring
- Entity relationship mapping
- Risk identification and flagging

### Design Phase: The Entity Active Management Framework

**Service Model Designed:**

The Entity Active Management (EAM) framework provides:

**1. Systematic Assessment Process:**
- Standardised assessment criteria and workflows
- Structured decision-making framework
- Reduced reliance on individual investigator experience
- Collaborative team-based review processes

**2. Continuous Entity Monitoring:**
- Real-time monitoring of entity relationships (not just point-in-time assessment)
- Financial, governance, and media notifications
- Proactive alerts when relationships or circumstances change
- Early identification of emerging risks

**3. Decision Support:**
- AI-assisted risk assessment and pattern identification
- Automated OSINT gathering and analysis
- Relationship mapping and visualisation
- Evidence compilation and audit trails

**4. Improved User Experience:**
- Clearer application processes
- Better status visibility
- Reduced processing times
- More consistent assessment outcomes

## Service Implementation

### Service Blueprinting

Created comprehensive service blueprints documenting:

**User Journeys:**
- Applicant journey from submission to decision
- Assessor journey through evaluation process
- Review team journey for complex cases
- Ongoing monitoring for approved entities

**Touchpoints Mapped:**
- Application submission
- Information requests
- Assessment milestones
- Decision communication
- Appeal processes
- Ongoing compliance monitoring

**Backstage Processes:**
- Information gathering automation
- Risk assessment workflows
- Team collaboration processes
- Decision escalation pathways
- Evidence management

### Technology as Service Enabler

The service was enabled using:
- **Dynamics 365** for case management and workflow
- **Azure Cognitive Services** for AI-assisted analysis
- **Azure Machine Learning** for risk pattern identification
- **SQL Analytics** for relationship mapping and data processing

**Important:** Technology supported the designed service—the service design drove technology selection, not the reverse.

### Agile Delivery

**Two three-week sprints:**
- Sprint 1: Core assessment workflow and entity management
- Sprint 2: Monitoring, alerts, and decision support features
- Continuous stakeholder feedback throughout
- Iterative refinement based on assessor use

## Key Service Design Learnings

### 1. Balance Automation with Human Judgement

**Challenge:** FPP assessment requires professional judgement—can't be fully automated

**Service Design Response:**
- Automate information gathering and routine analysis
- Provide decision support tools, not automated decisions
- Design for collaborative human review
- Preserve assessor expertise while reducing repetitive work

**Learning:** Technology should augment human expertise, not replace it—especially in complex regulatory judgement.

### 2. Design for Continuous Assessment, Not Point-in-Time

**Old Model:** Assess entity once at application
**New Model:** Continuous monitoring after approval

**Service Design Innovation:**
- Shift from "approve and forget" to "approve and monitor"
- Proactive identification of relationship changes
- Early warning system for emerging risks
- Ongoing entity relationship tracking

**Impact:** Better risk management through continuous service relationship, not one-off transaction.

### 3. Systematic Process Reduces Inconsistency

**Problem:** Assessment quality varied based on individual assessor experience

**Service Design Solution:**
- Standardised assessment criteria and workflows
- Structured decision-making framework
- Team-based collaborative review
- Audit trails and evidence requirements

**Result:** More consistent, defensible regulatory decisions while still allowing professional judgement where needed.

### 4. Stakeholder Engagement Throughout Design

**Approach:**
- Continuous involvement of regulatory staff
- Regular feedback loops during development
- Iterative refinement based on actual use
- Co-design of workflows with end users

**Impact:** Service designed with assessors, not for assessors—resulting in high adoption and improved outcomes.

## Regulatory Context

### Compliance & Governance

The service framework was designed to support:
- Legislative requirements across multiple acts
- Government digital service standards
- Information security and privacy requirements
- Audit and accountability obligations
- Evidence-based decision-making

### Risk Management

**Systematic Risk Identification:**
- Automated monitoring across financial, governance, and media sources
- Pattern recognition for high-risk indicators
- Relationship mapping for entity networks
- Proactive alerts for changes requiring attention

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how service design can transform complex regulatory processes by focusing on systematic approaches, collaborative workflows, and appropriate use of technology to augment human expertise.

**Key Service Design Achievements:**
- Translated complex regulatory assessment into systematic service framework
- Reduced processing time by 45% while improving quality
- Shifted from individual judgement to team-based collaborative assessment
- Enabled continuous monitoring, not just point-in-time decisions
- Improved experience for both applicants and regulatory staff

**The service design approach—not just technology—enabled this success.** By understanding the assessment process, identifying bottlenecks, and designing a service that worked with regulatory reality (not against it), we created a framework that improved both efficiency and quality.

The Entity Active Management service model is now used across multiple business units within the agency and provides a replicable framework for other regulatory assessment needs.
