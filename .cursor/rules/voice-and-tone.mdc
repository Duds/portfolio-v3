# Voice & Tone Rules for Marketing Copy

**CRITICAL:** All marketing copy, website content, case studies, emails, proposals, and client communications MUST follow these voice guidelines.

## Core Positioning

**Dale Rogers is a SERVICE DESIGNER, not a platform developer.**

- ✅ Service design is the primary offering
- ✅ Technology is an enabler, not the hero
- ✅ 15 years service design experience
- ✅ Focus: translating strategy into executable service models
- ❌ NOT a Dynamics 365 developer or Azure architect
- ❌ NOT primary platform implementer
- ❌ NOT technical certification focused

## Core Voice Requirements

### 1. Service Design First - ALWAYS Required
- ✅ Lead with service design challenge or framework
- ✅ Emphasise: user research, journey mapping, service blueprinting, co-design
- ✅ Focus on frameworks, blueprints, service models created
- ✅ Technology mentioned as enabler, not primary offering
- ❌ NEVER lead with "We build Dynamics 365 platforms"
- ❌ NEVER position as platform developer or technical implementer

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We design service frameworks that translate policy into executable delivery models"
- ✅ "Service blueprinting and stakeholder co-design for complex regulatory environments"
- ❌ "We build mission-critical Dynamics 365 and Azure solutions"
- ❌ "Custom platform development and technical implementation"

### 2. Systems Thinking - ALWAYS Required
- ✅ Acknowledge that people, process, technology are imperfect
- ✅ Show understanding of complex, real-world conditions
- ✅ Reference critical control thinking from mining background

- ❌ NEVER claim "seamless" or "perfect" anything
- ❌ NEVER ignore system imperfections

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Designed to work with imperfect systems and imperfect users"

- ❌ "Seamless integration across all systems"

### 3. Measurable Results - ALWAYS Required
- ✅ Include specific numbers: "78% improvement", "92% satisfaction", "2,200+ courses"
- ✅ Include timeframes: "4 weeks", "10 months", "6-month isolation"
- ✅ Include scale: "multi-stakeholder", "department-wide", "across 5 states"

### 4. Strategic Clarity - ALWAYS Required
- ✅ Use clear language: "translate", "design", "blueprint", "map", "co-design"
- ✅ Be direct: "We translate strategy into executable service models"
- ✅ Lead with service challenge or strategic need
- ❌ NEVER use passive voice unnecessarily
- ❌ NEVER use corporate jargon: "facilitate", "leverage synergies", "orchestrate"

### 5. Capability Transfer - ALWAYS Required
- ✅ Emphasise building client capability, not dependency

   - If NO = Add numbers or remove claim

4. **Positioning Test:** ✅ Is Dale positioned as service designer?
   - If positioned as developer = WRONG, rewrite

5. **Technology Role Test:** ✅ Is technology an enabler, not hero?
   - If technology is primary focus = Reframe

6. **Banned Words Test:** ✅ Zero buzzwords?
   - If found = Replace with specific terms

## AI Assistant Instructions

When writing or editing any marketing copy for Dale Rogers:

1. **First, check positioning:** Is Dale positioned as service designer (not platform developer)?
2. **Audit against checklist** above
3. **Flag any violations** of positioning or banned words
4. **Rewrite to match voice** before presenting
5. **Provide reasoning** for major changes

**Example Correction:**
- ❌ "We build mission-critical Dynamics 365 and Azure solutions for complex organisations"
- ✅ "We design service frameworks that translate policy into executable models for government and complex organisations"
- **Reasoning:** Removed platform developer positioning, emphasised service design, made technology context (not hero)

**Example Technology Context:**
- ❌ "Custom Dynamics 365 development and Azure architecture"
- ✅ "Service design for regulatory environments, with implementation using platforms like Dynamics 365 when appropriate"
- **Reasoning:** Service design first, technology as enabler

## Core Positioning Statement

**USE THIS to guide all copy:**

> "I'm a service designer specialising in translating strategy into executable service models for government and complex organisations. 15 years designing frameworks that work with imperfect people, processes, and technology. Critical control thinking from mining operations informs my approach to resilience and risk."

**Future Direction to Include:**

> "Shifting focus toward service design for social systems—public housing, youth justice, community resilience—where design directly improves outcomes for vulnerable groups."

## Compliance

**This is a HARD RULE file.**

All content MUST comply with these guidelines. If you cannot write copy that:
- Positions Dale as service designer first
- Acknowledges systems imperfection
- Shows technology as enabler not hero
- Demonstrates 15 years service design expertise

...then flag it for review rather than publishing non-compliant content.
