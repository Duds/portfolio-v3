## Integration with Other Commands

**Before Pre-Flight:**
1. Run `@audit-all` for comprehensive quality check
2. Fix any critical or high-priority issues found
3. Update documentation as needed

**During Pre-Flight:**
1. Work through this checklist systematically
2. Document any issues or exceptions
3. Get necessary approvals

**After Pre-Flight:**
1. If passed: Proceed with `@deploy`
2. If failed: Fix issues and re-run pre-flight
3. Document deployment in change log

## Automated Pre-Flight Script

For a partially automated check, create a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-flight.sh

echo "=== Running Pre-Flight Checks ==="

# Build
echo "1. Building..."
node scripts/build-content.js || exit 1

# Dependencies
echo "2. Checking dependencies..."
npm audit --audit-level=high || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerabilities found"

# Linting (if configured)
# npm run lint || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Linting issues found"

# Lighthouse
echo "3. Running Lighthouse..."
lighthouse http://localhost:8000 --quiet --chrome-flags="--headless"

echo "=== Pre-Flight Complete ==="
echo "Review results and complete manual checks"
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Fails
**Issue:** `node scripts/build-content.js` errors
**Fix:** Check markdown syntax in case studies, verify dependencies installed

### Low Lighthouse Scores
**Issue:** Performance, Accessibility, or SEO score < 90
**Fix:** Run specific audit (`@accessibility-audit`, `@seo-audit`), address findings

### Security Vulnerabilities
**Issue:** `npm audit` shows vulnerabilities
**Fix:** Run `npm audit fix`, update dependencies, review breaking changes

### Broken Links
**Issue:** 404 errors on links
**Fix:** Update incorrect URLs, ensure all pages exist, check relative paths

### Mobile Issues
**Issue:** Layout breaks on mobile
**Fix:** Test at all breakpoints, fix responsive CSS, ensure touch targets adequate

## Related Commands

- **@deploy**: Deploy to production after pre-flight passes
- **@build**: Build and preview locally
