# Accessibility Specialist Audit

## Purpose
Ensures the portfolio website meets inclusivity and compliance standards for WCAG 2.1 Level AA and Australian Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) requirements. This audit focuses on screen reader compatibility, semantic markup, and inclusive interaction patterns.

## Pre-Audit Setup

- [ ] Install screen readers for testing:
  - NVDA (Windows) or JAWS
  - VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
  - TalkBack (Android)
- [ ] Install browser extensions:
  - axe DevTools
  - WAVE Evaluation Tool
  - Accessibility Insights for Web
- [ ] Review existing documentation:
  - `.docs/design/accessibility-review.md`
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines

---

## 1. Semantic HTML Structure

### Document Structure
- [ ] Verify single `<h1>` per page with clear page title
- [ ] Check heading hierarchy flows logically (no skipped levels)
- [ ] Confirm landmark regions use semantic HTML5 elements:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
- [ ] Verify no presentational markup (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<center>`, etc.)
- [ ] Check lists use proper `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` structure
- [ ] Confirm data tables use `<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>` with appropriate scope

### Links and Navigation
- [ ] All links have descriptive text (no "click here" or "read more")
- [ ] Links opening new windows/tabs indicate so in text or ARIA label
- [ ] Skip navigation link present and functional
- [ ] Navigation landmarks properly labeled with `aria-label`
- [ ] Breadcrumbs use `nav` element with `aria-label="breadcrumb"`

### Forms
- [ ] All form inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- [ ] Labels use `for` attribute matching input `id`
- [ ] Required fields indicated with `required` attribute and visible indicator
- [ ] Error messages associated with inputs via `aria-describedby`
- [ ] Fieldsets group related inputs with descriptive `<legend>`
- [ ] Form validation provides clear, helpful error messages

### Images and Media
- [ ] All images have appropriate `alt` text:
  - Descriptive for informative images
  - Empty (`alt=""`) for decorative images
- [ ] Complex images (charts, diagrams) have long descriptions via `aria-describedby`
- [ ] Icon buttons have `aria-label` or visible text labels
- [ ] Video/audio has captions and transcripts
- [ ] No images of text (use actual text with CSS styling)

---

## 2. Screen Reader Testing

### VoiceOver (macOS)

- [ ] Test rotor navigation (VO + U) for headings, links, landmarks
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements are announced correctly
- [ ] Check form labels and error messages are read properly
- [ ] Test button states and purposes are clear

### NVDA (Windows)

- [ ] Reading order matches visual order
- [ ] Hidden content is properly hidden from screen readers
- [ ] Dynamic content updates are announced (ARIA live regions)
- [ ] Modal dialogs trap focus and have proper labels
- [ ] Loading states are announced to screen readers

---

## 3. Keyboard Navigation

### Navigation Flow

### Focus Management
- [ ] Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Focus indicators meet 3:1 contrast ratio requirement
- [ ] Focus indicator minimum 2px thick (current: 3px yellow)
- [ ] Focus doesn't disappear when interacting with elements

- [ ] Dropdowns/selects operate with arrow keys
- [ ] Custom components follow ARIA authoring practices
- [ ] Hamburger menu keyboard accessible (mobile)

---

## 4. ARIA Implementation

### ARIA Landmarks
- [ ] Use native HTML5 landmarks where possible

- [ ] Search landmarks have `aria-label="Search"`

### ARIA States and Properties
- [ ] Buttons show state with `aria-pressed` or `aria-expanded`
- [ ] Current page indicated with `aria-current="page"`
- [ ] Required fields have `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute
- [ ] Invalid fields have `aria-invalid="true"`
- [ ] Hidden content uses `aria-hidden="true"` or `hidden` attribute
- [ ] Live regions use appropriate `aria-live` values

### ARIA Best Practices
- [ ] No redundant ARIA (don't label elements that have native labels)
- [ ] ARIA roles match element semantics
