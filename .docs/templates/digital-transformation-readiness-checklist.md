## Critical Success Factors

Regardless of your score, these items are **non-negotiable** for success:

### Must-Haves

1. ‚úÖ **Executive sponsorship** - Without active leadership support, transformation will stall
2. ‚úÖ **User research** - Building without understanding users wastes time and money
3. ‚úÖ **Dedicated resources** - Part-time transformation efforts consistently fail
4. ‚úÖ **Change management** - Technical success means nothing without user adoption
5. ‚úÖ **Realistic timeline** - Rushed transformation creates technical debt and poor experiences

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ‚ùå **Technology-first thinking** - Start with user needs, not technology solutions
- ‚ùå **Waterfall approach** - Iterative, agile methods work better for transformation
- ‚ùå **Underestimating change** - Cultural change is harder than technical change
- ‚ùå **Ignoring staff concerns** - Staff resistance can derail even well-planned projects
- ‚ùå **No measurement plan** - Without metrics, you can't prove value or improve
