# Portfolio Refactor Summary - Correction to Modern Standards

**Date:** 15 October 2025  
**Type:** Course Correction - From Formal/Dated to Modern/Contemporary  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Went Wrong (Self-Critique)

### Initial Implementation Error

The first Art Director review recommended **IBM Plex Serif** typography, which was fundamentally **incorrect**. This created a portfolio that felt:
- ❌ Formal and traditional (like 2005 WordPress)
- ❌ Stuffy and old-fashioned  
- ❌ Out of alignment with modern service design studios
- ❌ Lost the approachable "Hello 👋" personality

### Dale's Accurate Feedback

> "The new design feels a little stuffy and old fashioned like wordpress templates in the early 2000's"

**He was absolutely right.** This was a fundamental misreading of the brief.

## Correct Direction (Validated by Studio Benchmarking)

### Modern Service Design Studios

After reviewing leading Australian and international service design studios, the pattern is clear:

**[IDEO](https://ideo.com):**
- Bold sans-serif throughout
- Minimal, confident, modern
- Warm through colour and space, NOT formality

**[Future Friendly](https://www.futurefriendly.team/) (Canberra):**
- "A strategic design team that makes"
- Action-oriented, contemporary
- Clean sans-serif, professional but approachable

**[Local Peoples](https://localpeoples.com) (Canberra):**
- Modern sans typography
- Warm, research-focused
- Citizen-centric design approach

**[Folk](https://www.folk.com.au/services/) (Melbourne):**
- Strategic design for health/government
- Clean, contemporary aesthetic
- Professional without stuffiness

**Common Pattern:** **ZERO heavy serif usage**. All use modern sans-serif. Warmth comes from colour, space, and interaction.

## Corrected Visual Strategy

### Typography Philosophy

**Correct Approach:**
"Modern service design uses contemporary sans-serif typography. Warmth and personality come from colour palette, spacing, and purposeful interaction—NOT from traditional formality."

**Implementation:**
- Work Sans (300, 400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
- Hierarchy: Bold (700) for headings, Medium (500-600) for emphasis, Regular (400) for body
- Amber colour for emphasis and focus
- Generous spacing for breathing room

### Brand Personality

**"Hello 👋" Logo:**
- Playful but professional
- Approachable differentiator
- Balances credibility with warmth
- Now consistent across all pages

**Tone:**
- Professional but contemporary (NOT corporate or formal)
- Approachable but credible (NOT casual or frivolous)
- Clear and structured (NOT stuffy or traditional)

### Visual Warmth Sources

**Correct Sources:**
1. **Colour:** Warm amber + neutral palette
2. **Space:** Generous whitespace and breathing room
3. **Interaction:** Subtle shimmer, smooth transitions
4. **Visuals:** Generative art patterns
5. **Components:** Section labels, results callouts

**NOT Through:**
- ❌ Formal serif typography
- ❌ Traditional typographic authority
- ❌ Heavy, formal presentation

## Generative Art System

### Purpose

Create project card visuals without photography or illustration budget through code-generated patterns.

### Implementation

**Technology:** Vanilla JavaScript + SVG  
**File:** `/js/generative-art.js`  
**Method:** Seed-based pattern generation  

### Domain Patterns

**Safety/Critical:**
- Grid-based, structured
- Colours: Cool greys/blues (#475569, #1E293B)
- For: Antarctic, Holden

**Regulatory/Government:**
- Layered rectangles
- Colours: Warm browns (#8B7355, #5C4A3A)
- For: ASIC, DCCEEW, Border Security

**Social/Community:**
- Organic curves
- Colours: Earth tones (#D4A574, #A67C52)
- For: Icon Water, MDBA

**Education/Research:**
- Geometric + organic mix
- Colours: Green-greys (#7C9885, #516857)
- For: University projects

### Usage

```html
<div class="card-image" 
     data-gen-art="safety" 
     data-project-name="antarctic"
     style="height: 200px;"></div>
```

Patterns generate automatically on page load—unique but consistent based on project name seed.

## Key Learnings

### What I Got Wrong

1. **Misread the benchmark** - Didn't actually study modern service design studios before recommending serif
2. **Assumed authority = formality** - Wrong. Authority comes from work quality, not formal typography
3. **Overlooked peer context** - Dale's direct competitors (Local Peoples, Future Friendly—both Canberra) use modern sans
4. **Lost the personality** - Changed "Hello 👋" header, losing approachable differentiation

### What I Should Have Done

1. **Benchmark first** - Actually review IDEO, Future Friendly, Local Peoples, Folk BEFORE recommending
2. **Preserve what works** - Work Sans was fine, yellow colour was the issue
3. **Modern warmth sources** - Colour, interaction, spacing—NOT formal typography
4. **Consistency** - Keep "Hello 👋" across all pages from the start

---

## Corrected Visual Strategy

### Typography
**Single modern sans-serif (Work Sans) creates hierarchy through:**
- Font weight variations (300-700)
- Size scale (12px-56px)
- Colour emphasis (amber for key elements)
- Spacing and layout

### Warmth Sources
**Add human texture through:**
1. Warm colour palette (amber + neutrals)
2. Generative art visuals
3. Smooth interactions
4. Purposeful animation
5. Approachable branding ("Hello 👋")

### Brand Personality
**Professional yet contemporary:**
- Clear and structured (NOT stuffy)
- Evidence-based (NOT performative)
- Approachable (NOT casual)
- Modern (NOT dated or formal)

---

## Next Steps

### Implement Generative Art Visuals

**1. Update index.html project cards:**
```html
<!-- Replace current gradients with: -->
<div class="card-image" data-gen-art="safety" data-project-name="antarctic" style="height: 200px;"></div>
```

**2. Update portfolio.html project cards:**
Apply same pattern to all project cards

**3. Add script to pages:**
```html
<script src="js/generative-art.js"></script>
```

**4. Test across devices:**
- Verify patterns generate correctly
- Check responsive behaviour
- Validate visual consistency

### Validation Checklist

## Acknowledgment of Error

The initial Art Director review contained a fundamental error in typography recommendation. **Apologies for the misdirection.** The serif approach was based on incorrect assumptions about what creates "authority" in service design portfolios.

**Correct understanding:** Modern service design is contemporary, not traditional. Warmth comes from colour and interaction, not formal typography. Work Sans was actually the right choice from the beginning.
