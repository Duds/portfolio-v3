# Voice & Tone Guide for Dale Rogers Marketing Copy

**Last Updated:** 15 October 2025  
**Purpose:** Establish consistent brand voice across all marketing materials, website copy, case studies, and client communications.

---

## Core Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. **Strategic Clarity**
We translate complex policy and strategy into clear, executable service models. We speak the language of SES-level decision-makers, directors, and program leads—not empty consulting rhetoric.

**What this sounds like:**
- "We design service frameworks that translate policy intent into executable delivery models"
- "The framework bridges strategy, architecture, and delivery—enabling resilience across Machinery of Government changes"
- "Our approach turns user needs, policy constraints, and system realities into clear service blueprints"

**Not:**
- "We leverage synergistic capabilities to drive transformation"
- "Our holistic approach enables digital reimagination"
- "We facilitate stakeholder-centric value creation"

### 2. **Evidence-Based & Measurable**
Every claim is backed by specific outcomes from real projects. We let the results speak.

**What this sounds like:**
- "Improved safety protocol adherence by 78% during 6-month Antarctic isolation"
- "Reduced procurement time by 50-70% through standardised framework approach"
- "2,200+ courses transitioned online in 4 weeks, achieving 92% student satisfaction"

**Not:**
- "Significantly enhanced operational efficiency"
- "Dramatically improved stakeholder outcomes"
- "Delivered substantial value across the organisation"

### 3. **Systems Thinking**
We acknowledge that people, processes, and technology are all imperfect. Our designs account for this reality.

**What this sounds like:**
- "Services designed to work with imperfect systems and imperfect users"
- "Critical control thinking from mining operations informs our approach to risk and resilience"
- "We design for how things actually work, not how they should work in theory"

**Not:**
- "Seamless integration across all systems"
- "Perfect alignment of people, process, and technology"
- "Flawless execution through cutting-edge methodology"

### 4. **Direct & Accessible**
No consulting waffle. We write clearly for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**What this sounds like:**
- "We translate strategy into executable service models"
- "Service design for complex regulatory environments"
- "Frameworks that enable government agencies to deliver consistent services"

**Not:**
- "We orchestrate transformative paradigms across enterprise ecosystems"
- "Our solutions empower stakeholders to reimagine value delivery"
- "We facilitate synergistic alignment of strategic imperatives"

### 5. **Collaborative, Not Transactional**
We build capability within client teams. We're trusted partners who complement delivery teams rather than compete with them.

**What this sounds like:**
- "We work collaboratively to build internal capability, not dependency"
- "Trusted above-the-line support that complements vendor delivery teams"
- "We enable your team while delivering outcomes"

**Not:**
- "Full-service end-to-end consulting engagement"
- "Comprehensive outsourced delivery solutions"
- "Turn-key transformation services"

## Tone Variations by Context

### For Hero/Homepage Copy
**Tone:** Clear value proposition with strategic positioning

**Formula:** `[What we do] + [Who for] + [Unique approach] + [Proof point]`

**Example:**
> "Service design for government and complex organisations. We translate strategy into executable service models—turning policy intent, user needs, and system constraints into frameworks that enable consistent delivery. 15 years designing services that work with imperfect people, processes, and technology."

### For Case Studies
**Tone:** Service design narrative with measurable impact

**Formula:** `[Service challenge] + [Design approach] + [Implementation context] + [Measurable outcomes] + [Strategic value]`

**Example Opening:**
> "The Department needed a standardised approach for delivering regulatory solutions across multiple environmental programs. The service design challenge was complex: fragmented delivery models, inconsistent approaches, and no shared service standards. We designed a Common Framework that bridges strategy, architecture, and delivery—reducing procurement time by 50-70% while enabling long-term resilience."

### For Service Descriptions
**Tone:** Capability-focused with clear outcomes

**Formula:** `[What we design] + [Approach/methods] + [What this enables for clients]`

**Example:**
> "Service Design & Strategy: We translate policy and strategy into executable service models through user research, service blueprinting, and stakeholder co-design. This enables government agencies to deliver consistent, evidence-based services that work in complex regulatory environments."

### For About/Background Copy
**Tone:** Professional narrative with authentic positioning

**Formula:** `[Unique positioning] + [Experience depth] + [Philosophy] + [What this enables]`

**Example:**
> "I'm a service designer specialising in translating strategy into executable service models for government and complex organisations. 15 years designing services across regulatory, environmental, and infrastructure portfolios. My philosophy: people, process, and technology are all imperfect—design must account for this reality. This approach, informed by early career in mining operations, enables frameworks that work in real-world conditions."

### For Technical Context
**Tone:** Technology as enabler, not hero

**Formula:** `[Service need] + [Technology role] + [Outcome focus]`

**Example:**
> "The service required field inspectors to verify compliance in remote locations. We designed workflows that worked offline-first, using PowerApps to enable the designed service. The technology supported the service model—not the other way around."

---

## Writing Rules

### Always Do:
1. **Lead with service design challenge** - Start with the problem being solved
2. **Use specific outcomes** - "78% improvement" beats "significant improvement"
3. **Name real clients and contexts** - Credibility comes from evidence
4. **Show systems thinking** - Acknowledge imperfect realities
5. **Emphasise frameworks and blueprints** - The designed artifacts
6. **Use Australian English** - Organisation, centre, realise, etc.
7. **Balance service and technology** - Technology enables service, not vice versa
8. **Focus on capability transfer** - We build client capability, not dependency

### Never Do:
1. **Position technology as the hero** - It's an enabler, not the solution
2. **Use buzzwords without meaning** - Synergy, leverage, paradigm, ecosystem
3. **Make unsubstantiated claims** - "Industry-leading" without proof
4. **Write in corporate-speak** - "Facilitate stakeholder engagement activities"
5. **Ignore system imperfections** - Don't claim seamless or perfect anything
6. **Hide behind passive voice** - "Was designed" vs "We designed"
7. **Claim to be developers** - We design services; we work with technical teams
8. **Over-emphasise platforms** - Dynamics 365 is context, not core offering

## Word Choice Guidelines

### Preferred Service Design Terms
- **What we do:** Design, translate, blueprint, map, co-design, facilitate
- **What we create:** Frameworks, service models, blueprints, strategies, roadmaps
- **Our approach:** User research, journey mapping, service blueprinting, co-design, stakeholder engagement
- **Outcomes:** Consistent delivery, policy translation, capability building, governance frameworks
- **Context:** Regulatory, policy, complex organisations, multi-stakeholder

### Avoid These Phrases
- ❌ "Platform development" → ✅ "Service design with appropriate technology"
- ❌ "We build Dynamics 365 solutions" → ✅ "We design services that may use platforms like Dynamics 365"
- ❌ "Technical implementation" → ✅ "Service implementation with technical components"
- ❌ "Cutting-edge technology" → ✅ "Appropriate technology to support service needs"
- ❌ "Seamless integration" → ✅ "Designed integration between imperfect systems"
- ❌ "Best-in-class platform" → ✅ "Service framework validated with [client]"
- ❌ "Full-stack developer" → ✅ "Service designer with technical understanding"
- ❌ "We code/build/develop" → ✅ "We design/blueprint/translate"

### Power Words (Use Sparingly)
- **Policy translation** - For government/regulatory work
- **Critical control thinking** - From mining background
- **Service framework** - For standardised approaches
- **Imperfect systems** - Acknowledging reality
- **Evidence-based** - Research-driven approach
- **Capability transfer** - Building client capability

---

## Sentence Structure Guidelines

### Rhythm and Flow
**Vary sentence length for impact:**
- Long sentences (20-25 words) for explaining service design approaches
- Medium sentences (12-18 words) for describing frameworks
- Short sentences (5-8 words) for emphasis

**Example:**
> "We translate strategy into executable service models for government and complex organisations. Policy intent, user needs, and system constraints become clear frameworks. That's what we do."

### Opening Sentences
**Start strong with one of these patterns:**

1. **Service challenge:** "The Department needed..."
2. **Strategic need:** "Government agencies require..."
3. **Design approach:** "We designed a service framework that..."
4. **Outcome first:** "Reduced processing time by 45%..."
5. **Systems reality:** "Complex organisations have imperfect people, processes, and technology..."

### Transitions
**Use these to connect ideas smoothly:**
- Between paragraphs: "This approach...", "The framework enabled...", "The service design..."
- Within design narrative: "First, we researched...", "Then we mapped...", "This informed..."
- Showing contrast: "Unlike platform-first approaches...", "Rather than technology-led..."
- Building on ideas: "This enabled...", "As a result...", "The framework then..."

---

## Formatting Standards

### Headlines
- **H1 (Page Title):** Clear service offering + audience (max 12 words)
  - ✅ "Service Design for Government & Complex Organisations"
  - ❌ "Digital Transformation Consulting Services"

- **H2 (Section Headers):** Service focus (2-5 words)
  - ✅ "Service Design Approach", "Framework Outcomes", "Strategic Impact"
  - ❌ "Platform Capabilities", "Technology Stack", "Development Services"

- **H3 (Subsections):** Specific framework or project name
  - ✅ "Digital Regulatory Service Reference Framework"
  - ✅ "Multi-Stakeholder Service Blueprint"

### Lists and Bullets
**Use bullets for:**
- Service design activities
- Research methodologies
- Framework components
- Deliverable artifacts

**Format:**
- Keep parallel structure (all start with verbs, or all nouns)
- Max 7 items per list
- Each item max 15 words
- No punctuation at end unless full sentences

**Example:**
```
Service design approach includes:
- User research across multiple stakeholder groups
- Journey mapping linked to operational processes
- Service blueprinting with governance frameworks
- Co-design workshops with agency staff
```

### Numbers and Data
**Always format for readability:**
- Use numerals: "15 years" not "fifteen years"
- Include units: "78% improvement" not "78 percent improvement"
- Use + for scale: "2,200+ courses"
- Round meaningfully: "92% satisfaction" not "91.7%"
- Include timeframes: "50-70% reduction over 10 months"

## Brand Voice Examples

### ✅ **Excellent - On Brand**

**Service Design Opening:**
> "Government agencies need consistent approaches for delivering regulatory services across multiple programs. We designed a Common Framework that standardises service patterns, governance, and vendor engagement—reducing procurement time by 50-70% while enabling resilience across Machinery of Government changes."

**Why it works:**
- Opens with service challenge
- Describes what was designed (framework)
- Specific measurable outcome (50-70%)
- Strategic value (resilience across MoG)
- No technology-as-hero language

### ✅ **Excellent - On Brand**

**About Statement:**
> "I'm a service designer specialising in translating strategy into executable service models. 15 years designing frameworks for government and complex organisations. My approach: people, process, and technology are all imperfect—design must account for this reality. Critical control thinking from mining operations informs how I design for resilience and risk."

**Why it works:**
- Clear service designer positioning
- Specific experience (15 years, government)
- Unique philosophy stated clearly
- Mining background adds credibility
- No false technical claims

### ❌ **Poor - Off Brand**

**Platform Developer Opening:**
> "We build mission-critical Dynamics 365 and Azure solutions for complex organisations. Our full-stack development expertise and cutting-edge platform capabilities deliver seamless digital transformation. From Antarctic research stations to Fortune 500 operations, we develop platforms that work."

**Why it fails:**
- Positions as platform developer (not service designer)
- Technology-as-hero language
- Buzzwords ("cutting-edge", "seamless")
- No service design emphasis
- Misrepresents actual capabilities

### ❌ **Poor - Off Brand**

**Vague Consulting Speak:**
> "We help organisations reimagine their digital journey through holistic, human-centred approaches that leverage best-in-class methodologies to facilitate transformative outcomes across the enterprise ecosystem."

**Why it fails:**
- Corporate buzzword soup
- No specific service offering
- No evidence or examples
- No clear differentiation
- Could be any consultant

## Testing Your Copy

### The Service Design Checklist
Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. **Service Focus Test:** Does it lead with service design challenge/outcome?
   - ❌ Technology/platform first = Wrong positioning
   - ✅ Service design first = Correct positioning

2. **Evidence Test:** Are claims backed by specifics?
   - ❌ "Significantly improved" = Vague
   - ✅ "Reduced by 45% over 8 months" = Specific

3. **Systems Thinking Test:** Does it acknowledge imperfect realities?
   - ❌ "Seamless, perfect solution" = Unrealistic
   - ✅ "Designed for imperfect systems" = Credible

4. **Capability Test:** Is service design expertise clear?
   - ❌ "We build platforms" = Wrong positioning
   - ✅ "We design service frameworks" = Correct positioning

5. **Differentiation Test:** Does it show unique approach?
   - ❌ "Full-service consulting" = Generic
   - ✅ "Policy translation + critical control thinking" = Unique

### The Read-Aloud Test
Read your copy out loud. If you:
- Sound like a platform vendor = Wrong positioning
- Sound like generic consultant = Too vague
- Can't explain the service challenge = Missing core narrative
- Use lots of buzzwords = Remove them

### The Client Test
Would an SES-level decision-maker or director:
- Understand what you design? (Service frameworks, not just platforms)
- See relevance to policy/strategy work? (Translation capability)
- Trust your government/regulatory expertise? (Evidence-based)
- Feel you'd build their capability? (Not create dependency)

- ❌ Buzzwords without meaning (synergy, leverage, seamless)
- ❌ Unsubstantiated claims (best, leading, world-class)

**Positioning Statement:**
"I translate strategy into executable service models for government and complex organisations—turning policy intent, user needs, and system constraints into frameworks that work with imperfect people, processes, and technology."
