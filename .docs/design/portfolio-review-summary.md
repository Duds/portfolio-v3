# Portfolio Review Executive Summary

**Date:** 15 October 2025  
**Review Type:** Art Director / Creative Director Assessment

⚠️ **REVISION:** Initial recommendations have been corrected. Serif typography approach was incorrect (too formal/dated). Correct direction: modern sans-serif (Work Sans), warm colour palette, generative art visuals. See refactor plan for proper implementation aligned with contemporary service design studios.

---

## Quick Assessment

**Overall Score:** 7.5/10

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Strategic positioning is excellent
- ✅ Content and case studies are evidence-based and credible
- ✅ Information architecture is clear
- ✅ Spacious layout communicates thoughtfulness

**What Needs Work:**
- ⚠️ Colour system (yellow → amber + warm neutrals)
- ⚠️ Typography (add serif for authority/depth)
- ⚠️ Emotional resonance (too muted, needs human warmth)
- ⚠️ Case study differentiation (all feel identical)

## Your Key Insight Was Right

> "I'd worry they'd say: 'It's smart and structured, but emotionally muted.'"

**This is exactly the gap.** The portfolio demonstrates senior strategic thinking but lacks the visceral energy needed to move from "respected" to "compelling"—especially for social systems reform work.

---

## The Fix: Three Strategic Moves

### 1. **Colour Evolution** (Highest Priority)
- Replace `#FFD700` (bright yellow) with warm amber (`#D97706`)
- Build warm neutral base: stone, beige, charcoal
- Use amber sparingly as "signal of focus"
- Inspired by IDEO's restrained accent approach

**Why:** Current yellow is too bright/attention-grabbing for your positioning. Warmer palette supports shift toward social systems work and adds tactile quality.

### 2. **Modern Typography** (CORRECTED - Keep Work Sans)
- **REVISION:** Serif was wrong—made portfolio feel dated like 2005 WordPress
- Keep Work Sans throughout (modern, clean, professional)
- All leading service design studios (IDEO, Future Friendly, Local Peoples, Folk) use modern sans
- Create hierarchy through weight, size, colour, spacing—NOT font formality

**Why:** Warmth comes from colour and interaction, not traditional typography. Service design is contemporary, not formal.

### 3. **Human Texture & Visual System** (Core Gap)
- Implement code-generated visuals (generative art) for project images
- Domain-coded patterns (safety=grids, government=layers, social=curves)
- Purposeful animation for emphasis
- Warm colour palette for tactility

**Why:** Bridges "intellect with empathy" through modern approach. No photography budget needed. Creates consistent, reproducible visual system through code. Aligns with contemporary service design studios.

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Update colour variables (amber system)
- Add serif font
- Update button styles
- Test WCAG compliance

### Phase 2: Hero Enhancement (Week 3)
- Elevate "From Policy to Practice" tagline
- Add subtle animation
- Strengthen hero visual impact

### Phase 3: Case Study Refinement (Week 4-5)
- Create domain-specific gradient variations
- Add section labels (Challenge → Approach → Result)
- Design results callout components
- Introduce texture overlays

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 6)
- Add interaction refinements
- Fix viewport scaling issues
- Enhance accessibility
- Final QA

## Minimum Viable Update (If Time-Constrained)

**Can't do full redesign? Focus here:**

1. Replace yellow with amber (`variables.css`)
2. Add serif for headlines only
3. Create results callout styling

**Impact:** ~50% of emotional improvement with ~20% of effort.

---

## The Antarctic Case Study Test

**Current:** Reads clearly but feels identical to other case studies.

**Goal:** Should convey isolation, extreme conditions, life-safety stakes, resilience.

**Fix:** 
- Cooler gradient (steel blue/charcoal)
- Pull quote: "How do you ensure safety protocols work with no connectivity for 6 months?"
- Results callout emphasising 100% uptime achievement
- Section labels to guide narrative

**If this works here, template extends to all case studies.**

## Success Metrics

After implementation, measure:

1. **Discovery call bookings** (your conversion goal)
2. **Qualitative feedback** - do people mention "compelling" not just "clear"?
3. **Time on case studies** - does engagement increase?
4. **Emotional response** - does it balance intellect with empathy?

## Next Steps

**Your Decision:**

**Option A: Full Evolution (6 weeks)**
- Implement Phases 1-4
- Complete visual system refinement
- Achieves strategic + tactical transformation

**Option B: Rapid Update (2-3 days)**
- Minimum viable changes
- Colour + typography only
- Quick win, iterate later

**Option C: Staged Rollout**
- Phase 1 now (foundation)
- Evaluate conversion impact
- Decide on Phases 2-4 based on results

**My Recommendation:** Option C (staged rollout)
- Foundation changes are low-risk, high-impact
- Gives you data to validate direction
- Allows refinement before full commitment
