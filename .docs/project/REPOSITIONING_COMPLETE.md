**Your new elevator pitch:**
"I'm Dale Rogers. I build Microsoft platforms for organizations with complex, mission-critical needs—from Antarctic research stations to Fortune 500 mining operations. Unlike typical consultants who just design and hand off, I take projects from service blueprint to working Dynamics 365 solution. If your environment is extreme or your requirements are complex, that's my specialty."

**Your proof points:**
