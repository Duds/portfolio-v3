## Quick Visual Check

### Open http://localhost:8080/index.html

**You should see:**

1. **HUGE hero text** - "From Policy to Practice" (110px)
2. **Dark services section** - charcoal background, white text, NO cards
3. **3 project cards with:**
   - Vibrant colored backgrounds (blue, brown)
   - Large white icons centered (shield, factory, scales)
   - Subtle pixel texture
   - Tags below descriptions
4. **Dark approach section** - simple list, NO boxes
5. **Results with big numbers** - 100%, Global, 4 Weeks in amber
6. **Dark about section** - narrow, clean, NO cards
7. **Final bold CTA** - "The future is made today"
   - **Scroll slowly** - background should fade to amber
8. **Black footer**

### Open http://localhost:8080/portfolio.html

**You should see:**

1. **Title:** "Work" (not "Service Design Portfolio")
2. **Filters:** "All Projects" (not "All Frameworks")
3. **Masonry grid** - 10 cards in **brick-style layout** (not perfect rows)
4. **All 10 cards have:**
   - Vibrant generative art (blues, browns, teals, purples)
   - 160px white icons (shield, factory, scales, wrench, ID, grad cap, airplane, drop, faucet, file)
   - Subtle 8-bit pixel texture
   - Tag pills (industry + tech tags)

**Test interactions:**
- Click different filters - cards filter and masonry rebuilds
- Hover cards - icons scale slightly
- Check mobile (resize browser) - 3 cols → 2 cols → 1 col

## Does It Still Feel "WP 2005"?

### Test Questions

**1. Typography:**
- Is the hero bold enough (110px)?
- Do section headers feel modern (80px)?

**2. Layout:**
- Does it feel less "templated"?
- Is the asymmetry working?
- Do dark sections help contrast?

**3. Project Cards:**
- Are icons visible and large enough?
- Is the masonry brick layout working?
- Are colors vibrant enough?

**4. Overall Feel:**
- Modern 2025 or still dated?
- Professional yet approachable?
- Like Future Friendly or still "stuffy"?

## If Adjustments Needed

### Typography
Edit `css/variables.css` lines 65-75 to adjust sizes

Edit `css/components.css` lines 336-337:
```css
width: 160px;  /* Increase/decrease */
height: 160px;
```

### Colors
Edit `js/generative-art.js` gradient colors (lines 30-150)

### Layout
Edit `css/layout.css` for section structures
